Contributing to a project
=========================

1. Fork the project you want to contribute to
2. Create a new branch on your fork (The name of the branch should reflect what you are looking to make)
3. Commit your changes to that branch. Here are some `tips for your commit messages <http://who-t.blogspot.de/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html>`_
4. Submit a pull request to the relevant repository. Before you submit it, you can perform the checklist below:

   * Does your change fit with the goals of the relevant project?
   * Does your code meet the Code Requirements?
   * Are all tests passing?
   * Is your pull request rebased to the latest commit of the target branch? If not, `rebase it <https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/>`_
