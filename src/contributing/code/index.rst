Contributing to a Project
========================= 

Making the changes
==================

1. Fork the project you want to contribute to
2. Create a new branch on your fork (The name of the branch should reflect what you are looking to make)
3. Make your changes. Keep in mind that your code should meet the :doc:`Code Requirements <code-requirements>`
4. Commit your changes to that branch. Here are some `tips for your commit messages <http://who-t.blogspot.de/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html>`_

Submitting the Changes
======================

Before submitting the changes, you should check if:

* All tests are passing.
* Your code meets the :doc:`Code Requirements <code-requirements>`
* Your branch is rebased to the latest commit of the target branch.

If you've done all that, you can finally submit a pull request to the relevant repository.

Updating the Documentation
==========================

All projects have a user documentation.
Since it's important that the documentation is always up-to-date, it would be nice to update the documentation, if needed, after a pull-request has been merged.
