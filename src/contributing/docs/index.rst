Making the changes
==================

1. Fork the documentation you want to contribute to
2. Create a new branch on your fork (The name of the branch should reflect what you are looking to make)
3. Make your changes. Keep in mind that your documentation should meet the :doc:`documentation requirements <requirements>`
4. Commit your changes to that branch. Here are some `tips for your commit messages <http://who-t.blogspot.de/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html>`_

Submitting the Changes
======================

Before submitting the changes, you should check if your branch is rebased to the latest commit of the target branch.
If that's the case, you can finally submit a pull request to the relevant repository.
